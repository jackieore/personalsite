            <p class="lead">I'm passionate about education and technology. Education is empowering and coding is an outlet where the developer can create technology that can make positive impact on individuals and communities. I am currently studying Computer Science at Dartmouth College. I want to share my skills with those younger than me in hopes that I can inspire other girls of color to pursue technology. I have been a technical mentor with Black Girls Code since March 2014. I believe that through early technology education we can change the face of technology by showing underrepresented students that they have the power to be a creator. </p>

            <p class="lead">I started vlogging because I did not see anyone who looked like me with a technology YouTube channel. I want to share my passion with the YouTube community in hopes that I inspire someone to learn how to code or show them that have the capability to be a maker of technology not just a consumer. I hope more women of color will join the technology vlogging space as well. On my channel, Code With Kaya, there are tutorial videos, resource videos, and as well as a monthly diverse news in tech video.

            <p class="lead">I built, designed, and launched an iPhone application called We Read Too. We Read Too is a book resource app that includes over 350 books written by people of color featuring characters of color. You can browse different genres, search by author or title, view the details of every book, suggest any books to be added, as well as view the book on the web through Safari. This app is very important to me because I've always loved reading from the moment I learned how to, but I constantly found that I couldnâ€™t relate to the characters in popular books. I created this application so diverse books can be showcased in one central place where readers can find books with diverse characters they can relate to. The app currently has over 1,500 users and has received great ratings in the App Store. <a href="http://bit.ly/1mUfe2F">Download</a> the app for free on iTunes!

Like the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/WeReadTooApp">Facebook</a> page where I post Author Spotlights, Series to Watch, and Book of the Day all from the 350+ books that are included in the app. Follow the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/WeReadTooApp">Twitter</a> page to be apart the conversation about the importance of diverse books, give any questions/feedback about the app or any suggestions for books that should be added! </p>
